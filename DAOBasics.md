# Project - DAO

## History of DAO's?

* The concept of DAO was proposed by  Daniel Larimer in September, 2013. However, since bitcoin doesn't support smart contracts, DAO's implementation didn't really started until the launch of ethereum.

## The DAO:
* On April 30, 2016, a startup team called The DAO raised $150 million in just 28 days through an ICO crowdfunding on Ethereum using smart contracts, becoming the largest crowdfunding project in history. This marked the first practice of DAOs.

## What is a DAO?

* DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. It is a decentralized organization managed by smart contracts
    * It has no centralized leadership
    * DAO is governed by all its members
    * DAO members can vote to make decisions for the organization

* NOTE: In short, DAO is a new type of organizational structure that aims to transcend traditional organizational forms and make collective decisions in a distributed, transparent, and trust-minimized way.

### Characterstics of A Dao: 

1. Decentralization: One of the main characterstic of DAO is that it is decentralized which means no single authority controls it.The decision-making and execution processes of DAOs are automatically executed by smart contracts, and are not controlled by any individual or group.

2. Autonomy: Another core characteristic of DAOs is autonomy. This means that the operating rules of DAOs are defined by smart contracts, and all members can participate in the governance of the organization. 

3. Transparency: DAOs are considered more transparent, all the actions performed are recorded on the blockchain and everyone can view them. This means that all members can understand the organization's financial status, decision-making process, and other information.

4. Minimized Trust:DAOs uses smart contracts for trust.  Smart contracts are codes that run on the blockchain and can automatically execute preset terms and conditions, ensuring that the operation of DAOs is in the interests of all members.

# Types of DAOs:

### Protocol DAO:

* A Protocol Decentralized Autonomous Organization is a DAO responsible for developing and managing decentralized applications.The main task of this type of DAO is to develop open-source technology, similar to a company or foundation.

    * Protocol DAOs have the following characteristics:
        1. The primary goal of these DAOs is to develop and maintain open-source technology, providing infrastructure for dApp development.
        2. Protocol DAOs generally adopts a decentralized governance model  where token holders participate in the organization's decision-making and management.
        3. The code and operation of Protocol DAOs are usually open and transparent, and anyone can participate.

* Examples of Protocol DAOs

    * MakerDAO: MakerDAO is responsible for managing the decentralized stablecoin DAI. DAO members are responsible for setting parameters for the protocol, such as adjusting interest rates, adding/removing collateral assets, and onboarding/offboarding core team members.

### Investment DAOs

* An Investment Decentralized Autonomous Organization is a DAO responsible for managing or controlling funds in the DAO treasury.The main purpose of this type of DAO is to generate profits for its members, similar to a private equity fund or hedge fund.

    * Investment DAOs have the following characteristics:
        * The main goal of this DAO is to generate profit from investments.
        * These DAO's follows a decentralized governance model, where token holders participate in the organization's decision-making and management.
        * Investment DAOs can have diversified investment strategies, including investing in assets such as cryptocurrencies, stocks, and real estate.

* Examples of Investment DAOs:
    * BitDAO: BitDAO is a DAO where BIT token holders vote on various investment strategies and generate profit for the DAO treasury. BitDAO claims to have invested over $3.8 billion in Web3 projects.


### Social DAOs

* This type of DAO is responsible for managing a shared social space, co-owning valuable assets, and creating a culture and organizing events for its members.Social DAOs organize communities around entertainment, art, gaming, and other social areas, similar to modern social clubs.

    * Social DAOs have the following characteristics:
        1. The main focus of this DAO is to  provide a platform for members to communicate and interact, and build social relationships.
        2. Like any other DAO this type of DAO also follows the decentralized governance model where token holders participate in the organization's decision-making and management.
        3. Social DAOs usually build unique cultures and organize various events, such as parties, game competitions, etc.

* Examples of Social DAOs
    * Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC): BAYC is a limited-edition NFT collection, where each NFT serves as a membership pass and grants access to special benefits. The BAYC community has a rich culture and organizes various events, such as offline parties and game competitions.


# DAO Functions: 

## Approving Upgrades and Open-sourcing:

### What is Approving Upgrades and Open-Sourcing Protocols?

Approving Upgrades and Open-Sourcing Protocols refers to the decision making process by which a DAO community upgrades or open-sources a protocol. 

* This process invloves the below steps:
    1. Proposing an Upgrade or Open-Sourcing: Community members can propose upgrading or open-sourcing the protocol and detail the proposal's content and rationale.
    2. Community Discussion: Community members discuss the proposal and provide feedback and suggestions.
    3. Voting: Community members vote on the proposal to decide whether to approve it.

* Approving Upgrades and Open sourcing protocols can help and benefit DAO immensely
    * Upgrades results in improved protocol efficiency, fixes for vulnerabilites found in the protocol etc.
    * On the other hand, Open-source allows more people to participate and contribute to the protocol.

* Example:
    *  Uniswap is a decentralized exchange protocol. The Uniswap community voted to upgrade Uniswap V2 to Uniswap V3 to improve the protocol's capital efficiency and scalability.

## Long-Term Roadmap Decision-Making in DAOs:

* Long-term roadmap decision-making in DAOs refers to major decisions about the future direction of a DAO, such as:
    * What is the DAO's ultimate vision?
    * In which areas will the DAO develop?
    * What technologies and strategies will the DAO adopt?

* Process of Formulating Long-Term Roadmaps
    * Community members discuss the future development of the DAO and make suggestions.
    * The core team or community members formulate specific proposals based on the results of the community discussion.
    * Community members vote on the proposal to decide whether to adopt it.

* Example:
    *  Aave is a decentralized lending protocol. The Aave community voted to expand the Aave protocol to multiple blockchain networks to improve the protocol's usability and scalability. 


# DAO Tools:

DAO tools refer to tools that helps and manages DAO operations.  These tools can help DAO communities make decisions, execute tasks, and manage assets more efficiently.

## Types of Tooling:

* Governance Tools: Tools that helps DAO make decision and Vote such as snapshot
* Communication Tools:  Tools that helps DAO's to communicate such as Discord, telegram etc
* Project Management Tools: Tools that helps DAO's to manage project and tasks such as Trello, JIRA etc
* Financial Management Tools:  Tools that help DAOs manage assets and financial situations, such as Gnosis Safe, Zerion, and Dune Analytics.


### Application of these tools:

* DAOs combines multiple tools to establish a multi-DAO level architecture:
    1. Goverance Token: Allows token holders special rights such as they allowed to vote 
    2. Multi-Sig Wallet: Used to manage DAO funds, requiring multiple signatures to execute transactions.
    3. Voting Contract: Coordinates on-chain voting
    4. Delegation: Allows token holders to delegate voting rights to others.
    5. Off-Chain Snapshot: Voting off-chain, no need to pay gas fees.
    6. Forum: For community communication and discussion.

## More on Governance Tokens:

* Governance tokens are tokens issued by DAOs that grant special powers to token holders. The biggest use of governance tokens is voting, for example, one token equals one vote.
    * Governance tokens holders can participate in DAO decision making, holders can share in DAO's profit and these tokens are also used as incentive mechanism to participate in the construction and development of the DAO.


## More on Multi-Sig Wallets:

* This type of wallet requires multiple signatures before approving the transaction. to participate in the construction and development of the DAO.

### Advantages of Multi-Sig Wallets:

* Requires multiple signatures to approve any transaction thus improving the security and prevent the theft of a single key.
* Control can be distributed to multiple key holders, avoiding abuse of power by a single holder


# Voting Contracts

A voting contract is a smart contract that coordinates on-chain token-weighted voting for a proposal. It can be used for various DAO decisions, such as Fund Allocation, New Member Admission and Protocol Parameter change.


## How Voting Contracts Work

1. Proposal Submission: The proposer submits a proposal, including the proposal content and the required voting weight.
2. Voting Stage: Token holders can vote according to their wishes and use their tokens as voting weight.
3. Counting Stage: After the voting ends, the voting contract will count the votes according to the predefined conditions.
4. Execution Stage: If the voting result meets the conditions, the proposal content will be executed.

### Types of Voting Contracts:

* Simple Voting Contracts: Only support simple yes/no voting.
* Complex Voting Contracts: Support more complex voting mechanisms, such as voting that supports multiple candidates or multiple options.


Hoped, you learned some DAO basic from the above.
